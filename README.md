I'm going to be perfectly honest.
This is a mess.
What with my VM dying, and then this computer having all the issues with the seg faults and the hard drive literally falling out at points, I'm personally impressed in myself for getting this far. 
It's possible to create a user, log in, and navigate somehow to the search page; the search page currently leads to a morass of errors and pain visible in search_helper.rb. I would appreciate leniency but I don't expect it.
